Hi, I’m @imker25

## Profession

I work at a German Company as software developer. I mainly work on *continuous integration* and *continuous deployment* pipelines and on tools needed within this pipelines. At work I mainly develop for Windows and use `C#`, `dotnet`, `powershell`, `groovy`, `Azure Devops` and `Jenkins` as basic technologies.

## GitHub

This GitHub account is used for my private projects. Here a usually do tools and stuff that is Linux related or Cross-Platform. I mainly use `golang` for this projects. Due to my profession my projects here always provide automated **CI/CD** workflows.

## GitHub Projects

The two main projects I do here on GitHub are [gpsa](https://github.com/imker25/gpsa) and [samba_exporter](https://github.com/imker25/samba_exporter).

### GPSA

I invented the tool [gpsa](https://github.com/imker25/gpsa) since I'm doing a lot of outdoor activities like skiing and mountain-biking. While doing this activities I create a lot of GPS-Track-Files of my routes to the nature. So to do statistical analyses of the track data I record, without needing to upload the tracks to non privacy friendly services, I decided to create this tool.

The tools can be used to for example figure out the average distance of my bike rides last month.

### samba_exporter

At my home I'm running a bunch of services within my Linux Based *Home Server* installation. To monitor this services I use the  [prometheus/grafana](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/) stack. But since a *Home Server* needs to provide Windows shares there is also a [samba](https://www.samba.org/) installation running.

But within the prometheus stack a [exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/) to monitor the **smbd** daemon is missing. So I started this project.
